            I know I didn't make a creative birthday card like you did for me, but I wanted to put a little of myself
            into this
            message. You truly are the best person Iâ€™ve ever met. Thank you for always being there, helping me through
            every
            situation. I know I can be a bit much sometimes, but you always stay calm and help me in every way.

            <br><br>I hope this year becomes the best year of your life, and that each year only gets better from here.

            <br><br>Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’–
